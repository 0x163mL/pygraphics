QUESTIONS

picture.py:

add_rect and add_rect_filled checks for valid width/height inputs, but only raises an exception of both are less than 0. Shouldn't it be a problem if either one is? The description states that x,y should be the upper left-hand corner, and if either h or w is < 0, this is not the case.
